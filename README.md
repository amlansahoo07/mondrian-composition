# Mondrian Composition Project

This project is a recreation of Piet Mondrian's "Composition No. III with Red, Blue, Yellow, and Black" using HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates the use of CSS Grid to create complex layouts and pays homage to the iconic abstract artwork. 

## Overview

The goal of this project is to replicate the geometric composition of Mondrian's artwork using modern web technologies. The layout features a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles filled with primary colors and non-colors.

## Features

- Accurate replication of Mondrian's "Composition No. III, with Red, Blue, Yellow, and Black"
- Responsive design using CSS Grid
- Clean and minimalistic HTML structure with internal CSS

## Project Details

### HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure for the composition. The content includes several div elements, each item representing a colored block in the composition, with internal CSS for styling.

### Internal CSS Styling

The CSS styles are embedded directly within the HTML file. Key styles include:

- Flexbox for centering the composition within the viewport
- CSS Grid for layout management
- Border and background styling to create the grid lines
- Background colors for the different blocks

2. Navigate to the project directory:
